# csc 196D Introduction to BlockChain

a decentralized platform moves the centralized control away and redistributes it into the hands of the volunteers so that it will provide the same opportunities based on the volunteers' own choice to allow more control into the hands of the volunteers. By removing the middleman, volunteer opportunities can be shared and accessed more freely, based on individual choice and community needs. A decentralized application could leverage technologies such as blockchain and smart contracts to facilitate a peer to peer network where users can accept, and manage volunteer tasks.
